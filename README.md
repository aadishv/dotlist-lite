[Dotlist](https://dotlist.edwrdq.xyz/) is a popular open-source task management app. It's currently maintained by edwrdq; I (aadishv) am a contributor to the project. I wrote out much of the core UI code which the app lives on today.

Dotlist Lite (this repo) is a lightweight version of Dotlist, designed to be fast and efficient, with a focus on simplicity and ease of use. It has the same core idea as Dotlist -- lists of items with a red/yellow/green status -- and the same tech stack and interactions, but guts Dotlist of its more complex features. Removed features:

* Notifications
* Teams
* AI features
* Task deadlines
* Comments
* etc.

By using Dotlist Lite, you trade away these features for a much nicer and more polished UX. Because there are less features overall, I spent a lot of time optimizing micro-interactions and the overall feel of the app to make sure it feels snappy, responsive, fluid, clean, and elegant.
